                  California law permits residents of California to request
                  certain details about what personal information a company

                <h3>Do Not Track Requests</h3>
                <p>
                  Certain browsers have incorporated{' '}
                  <strong>Do Not Track features</strong>. Most of these
                  features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the
                  websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be
                  tracked. Those sites (or the third-party content on those
                  sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as
                  tracking even though you have expressed this preference,
                  depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Because there is
                  not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the Do Not
                  Track signal, Iron Cove Solutions does not currently respond
                  to the browser Do Not Track signals on its websites or online
                  services.
