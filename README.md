## Contentful Business Rules
* Only Technologies with a plan should select true for radio button
    - All others must leave blank
* All Technologies should have a singular companyName spelled with a capital Letter (HP, Microsoft, Auth0)
* The technology pages can either be a pure technology page or a plan page. If you want to make a technology page a plan page, you select the plan radio button in contentful and make sure you fill out the Company Name (singular, one word, Capitalized). In Contentful you will still see all the fields for technology or plan but if you are creating a plan page you only need to fill out the "Why Use Us" field and you can leave all the other fields blank. (but you also need to fill out a title, slug, plan, company name and featuredImage)
* All links must not end with a forward slash so use `/about` instead of
`/about/`
* All technology must have a company name entered in Contentful
* All technology must have a featuredImage
* Gatsby needs `_redirects` created inside `static` folder
